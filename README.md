## PHP wrapper function plugin:gem::sparkles:

One day I read [PHP manual](https://secure.php.net/manual/). Why Warning? It's 伝統的な仕様(traditional specification)? or 黒歴史(Black history)?. I don't like it, It's 中二病(CHYU NI BYO). I think many PHP user is make wrapper functions.  
So I make wrapper functions plugin. They are very simple and easy logics. If I make reinvent the wheel, please tell me.
